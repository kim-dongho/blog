Hi, I'm KIM DONGHO<br />
I am a database kernel engineer and an open-source enthusiast.<br />
Currently, I am contributing to [WeScale](https://github.com/wesql/wescale), a database proxy designed to enhance the scalability, performance, and resilience of MySQL.
My contributions include implementing features such as Read-Write Splitting, [Read-After-Write Consistency](https://github.com/wesql/wescale/blob/main/doc/design/20230414_ReadAfterWrite.md), Load Balancing, and Online DDL.

Previously, I worked in the [PolarDB-X](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql) distributed database team at Alibaba, where I was responsible for developing features related to DDL (Data Definition Language). <br />
I Lead the design and implementation of the [DDL execution engine (Code Here)](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql/blob/main/polardbx-executor/src/main/java/com/alibaba/polardbx/executor/ddl/newengine/DdlEngineDagExecutor.java) in PolarDB-X, which allows the database system to maintain ACID properties during schema changes.<br />

Before that, I was a web backend developer specializing in data-intensive applications. <br />
The experience I gained in both database kernel development and application development has greatly enhanced my architectural design skills.

I am a beginner in front-end development, but recently I have become very interested in it. I am currently deepening my knowledge of Next.js.

This is a simple example of using JSX inside a Markdown file.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}>
      <h1>Hello, Markdown with JSX!</h1>
      <p>This is a React component embedded in a Markdown file.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
